The idea was to build a storage device with an easy way to increase its capacity and with data replication.
The device was built on top of Raspberry Pi with analog gauges, switches, and a display to indicate
and control storage state.

<!-- /preview -->

## What is this?

![sloth-storage result](/images/posts/10-raspberry-pi-storage/sloth-storage-result.jpg)

This is a stand-alone storage device, that can connect to WiFi and provides FTP interface to access files remotely.
When the client copies a file to the storage, this file gets replicated to different USB drivers.
If the client removes some file, it gets removed from all the USB drives.

There are two options when the storage is almost full:
- plug in a new USB drive (the storage will start utilizing the new drive)
- decrease replication count using "*Replicas*" selector and get more storage space but with losing reliability.

Replication count selector ("*Replicas*") has four positions (1-4) to choose the value.
There are two analog gauges, the first one for storage utilization, and the second one for CPU usage.
On/Off toggle switch in the final version is used to enable/disable FTP server.
There is a yellow LED to indicate storage IO, and a red LED to indicate that an error occurred.

Main display switch has eight positions:
- *Total/free/used capacity* -- storage capacity numbers
- *Time* -- current device time (if itâ€™s frozen then you NodeJS event loop got blocked :)
- *Error* -- scrolls the last error message
- *Sync Status* -- shows replication queue length
    (how many files have to be replicated/removed to reach the desired state)
- *Drives* -- the count of detected drivers
- *IP* -- scrolls device IP address.

### Box

I found bamboo as a cheap and very friendly looking material for DIY cases.
Also wood is much easy to fix and adjust by cutting and sanding than metal.

Work started with measurements and blueprint preparing:
![sloth-storage blueprints](/images/posts/10-raspberry-pi-storage/sloth-storage-blueprints-pencil.png)

I prepared SVG files of the case and ordered laser cutting and engraving on [ponoko.com](https://www.ponoko.com/).
After a while I got this:
![sloth-storage laser cuts arrived](/images/posts/10-raspberry-pi-storage/sloth-storage-laser-cuts.jpg)
I got this by mail.
All materials come covered with protection paper.

Box panels are pulled out, corner connectors already glued together:

Panels adjustment and fitting:

Case SVG blueprints can be found
[here](https://github.com/antonfisher/sloth-storage/blob/master/blueprints/box.svg).

### Analog gauges

First of all, I tried to print scale for analog gauges on a paper but was not satisfied by the result.
And in the end, I decided to ordered engraving on thin styrene white sheets (0.02 inches)
on the same [website](https://www.ponoko.com/) I used for the case.
Crayons appear to be an excellent option to paint engraved traces.
I made black and orange sections:
![sloth-storage gauges painting process](/images/posts/10-raspberry-pi-storage/sloth-storage-gauges-painting.jpg)

The result, before and after painting:

This is how it looks in-action inside voltmeter:

### Display

I used [Pimoroni Micro Dot pHAT](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3248) as the only display on the device.
The display consists of six segments, and each segment has 5x7 dots (not assembled yet):
![pimoroni phat display](/images/posts/10-raspberry-pi-storage/sloth-storage-phat.jpg)
There is comprehensive [Python library](https://github.com/pimoroni/microdot-phat)
that makes Micro Dot pHAT even easier to use.
The library supports following actions: single dot turning on/off, printing text, and scrolling.
This is how it looks in action (I used RPi Zero to debug display's code):

### Assembling

Put the case and indicators together:
![sloth-storage case and controls assembled](/images/posts/10-raspberry-pi-storage/sloth-storage-box-and-controls-assembled.jpg)

The case got packed with components, but still, the height could be decreased at least on 1cm (0.4 inches):
![sloth-storage inside side](/images/posts/10-raspberry-pi-storage/sloth-storage-inside-side.jpg)

Raspberry Pi has 40-pins header, and the device uses almost all of them.
Also, all 4 Raspberry Pi's USB ports were used by USB HUBs to increase the total port count to 16:
![sloth-storage inside back](/images/posts/10-raspberry-pi-storage/sloth-storage-inside-back.jpg)

There is an issue with USB HUBs, I had to be careful with power.
It turned out that I can't use 3A power supply to power 16 USB ports and RPi itself.
In my case, the maximum number of USB devices was 4-5, after this numbers they usually get unmounted randomly.
When 10 USB drives are connected, Raspberry Pi seems to work fine, but only until any IO operation,
then RPi completely cuts the power from all USB devices, and you have to re-mount them.

## Application

The tech stack is JavaScript (Node.js) the core application and small Python driver for the display.
JS is not the best choice for this kind of programs but given the experimental nature of this project,
figuring out the limitations of Node.js was interesting.
The main rule there -- to use only asynchronous functions in the application, this doesn't block JS event loop,
and application reacts fine on user interactions (switches, buttons).
Still impossible to get perfect execution timing required to manage some hardware components, but this wasn't needed.

All USB drives connected for the first time:

![sloth-storage flashlights](/images/posts/10-raspberry-pi-storage/sloth-storage-flashlights.gif)
</center>

I used [rpio](https://github.com/jperkin/node-rpio) Node.js library that has basic API for setting levels on pins,
as well as PWM control (for voltmeter gauges) and can execute callbacks on level change (pin as an input.)

Debug moment when the application fell to PANIC mode:
<center>
![sloth-storage got panic on debug](/images/posts/10-raspberry-pi-storage/sloth-storage-debug-panic.jpg)
</center>

## Conclusion

The storage is terribly slow, and this is the limitation of USB drives, it only can be used as a backup solution.
However, there is a room for performance improvements, USB hard drives can help with increasing the speed, also,
the application can be optimized to utilize all four Raspberry Pi cores
(Node.js runs in a single process, currently only display driver runs in a separate process.)

There are some positive things there too.
I like device's bamboo case, and that I found the way to make such a thing, it definitely can find a place on shelves.
Analog gauges look old and cool, it's a clear way to indicate both,
the current value and the possible range of some metric.

The takeaways from the experiment are:
- bamboo is a worthwhile material for DIY
- analog gauges is an excellent way for representing usage information
- keep an eye on the power consumption of all hardware components
- Node.js fits well for hacking projects when you are not lazy to follow its async guides.

As always, after finish a project I came up with two ideas of what to do next!
